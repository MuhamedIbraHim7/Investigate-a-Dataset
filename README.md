# Investigate a Dataset
 In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings of it. I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.
# Medical Appointment No Shows
A person makes a doctor appointment, receives all the instructions and no-show. Who to blame? This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
